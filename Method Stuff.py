'''
Write a function called closest that takes a list of numbers L and
a number n and returns the largest element in L that is not larger
than n. For instance, if L=[1,6,3,9,11] and n=8, then the function
should return 6, because 6 is the closest thing in L to 8b that is
not larger than 8. Donâ€™t worry about if all of the things in L are
smaller than n.
